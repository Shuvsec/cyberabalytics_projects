README: K-Means Clustering on Iris and Wine Datasets

Description:
This program demonstrates the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Iris and Wine datasets. 

Two implementations of the K-Means algorithm are provided:

A custom implementation using the standard Euclidean distance.
A modified implementation using a simplified form of the Mahalanobis distance.

Dependencies:

Python 3.7 or higher
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

How to Run:

Ensure you have Python installed and the above-mentioned libraries.
Save the provided code in a file, say kmeans_clustering.py or just use the notebook provided and run it on google collab.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the file.
Run the script using the command: python kmeans_clustering.py.
