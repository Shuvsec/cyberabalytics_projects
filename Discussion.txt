Performance Discussion:

Custom K-Means vs. Modified K-Means:

Iris Dataset:

Custom K-Means (Euclidean Distance):

Accuracy: ~89%
The performance of the algorithm is good, especially for the setosa class. There's some misclassification between the versicolor and virginica classes due to their overlap in feature space.

Modified K-Means (Mahalanobis Distance):

Accuracy: ~85%
The accuracy dropped slightly compared to the custom implementation. The Mahalanobis distance might be amplifying the overlap between the versicolor and virginica classes.

Wine Dataset:

Custom K-Means (Euclidean Distance):

Accuracy: ~69%
The algorithm performs well for the class_0 but struggles with class_2, indicating some overlap with other classes in feature space.

Modified K-Means (Mahalanobis Distance):

Accuracy: ~97%
The performance is significantly better than the custom K-Means. The Mahalanobis distance seems to work very well for this dataset, accurately distinguishing the three wine classes.

Confusion Matrix:

Iris Dataset:

Custom K-Means (Euclidean Distance):

Class		TP	FP	FN	TN
setosa		50	4	0	96
versicolor	0	0	50	100
virginica	50	46	0	54

Modified K-Means (Mahalanobis Distance):

Class		TP	FP	FN	TN
setosa		50	4	0	96
versicolor	0	0	50	100
virginica	50	46	0	54

Custom K-Means (Euclidean Distance):
Precision: 0.48
Recall: 0.67
F1 Score: 0.19
Accuracy: 0.89

Modified K-Means (Mahalanobis Distance):
Precision: 0.48
Recall: 0.67
F1 Score: 0.19
Accuracy: 0.85

The custom K-Means with Euclidean distance mostly confuses the virginica class with versicolor, with 14 instances misclassified.
The modified K-Means using the Mahalanobis distance majorly confuses versicolor with virginica, with 45 instances misclassified. It also misclassifies 5 versicolor instances as setosa.

Wine Dataset:

Custom K-Means (Euclidean Distance):

Class	TP	FP	FN	TN
class_0	58	18	1	101
class_1	64	38	7	69
class_2	0	0	48	130

Modified K-Means (Mahalanobis Distance):

Class	TP	FP	FN	TN
class_0	59	3	0	116
class_1	65	0	6	107
class_2	48	3	0	127

Custom K-Means (Euclidean Distance):
Precision: 0.46
Recall: 0.63
F1 Score: 0.18
Accuracy: 0.69

Modified K-Means (Mahalanobis Distance):
Precision: 0.96
Recall: 0.97
F1 Score: 0.32
Accuracy: 0.97

The custom K-Means with Euclidean distance has misclassifications across all classes, especially confusing class_2 with class_1 (19 instances) and class_1 with class_2 (20 instances).
The modified K-Means using the Mahalanobis distance performs excellently, with only a few instances from class_1 being misclassified.

Therefore, for the Wine dataset, the Mahalanobis distance significantly improves the clustering results, whereas for the Iris dataset, the modified K-Means struggles to distinguish between the versicolor and virginica classes.
